# Project ICARUS - Communications Reliability Challenge
This challenge simulates those realities through a staged dataset of received signals. Each phase  introduces controlled impairments—timing errors, noise calibration traps, coding requirements, and  Doppler shifts—that mirror conditions encountered in low Earth orbit.
